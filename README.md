# Object tracking and detection framework

This project aims to develop a simple and efficient 
object tracking and detection framework using yolo for raspberry pi.
Currently readNet feature for opencv3.4 is only for python 3.5, hence pls use python3.5 when you run this code. 

# Installing opencv3.4 on raspberry pi 3

After you have git clone this repo into your home directory 
```
mv ~/object-tracking-detection/opencv_install ~/opencv_install.sh
sudo ./opencv_install.sh
```
# Dependencies 
1. opencv3.4
2. Scipy
